NAME
    CPAN::Porters - resource for people maintaining packages of CPAN modules
    in various distributions

SYNOPSIS
    CPAN modules can be either installed from source (downloaded directly
    from CPAN) or they can be installed with the package mangement system of
    your distribution.

    CPAN::Porters is a resource for people who are maintaining those
    packages in the various distributions.

Reasoning
    When developing an application we usually don't want to build our own
    machine. Neither compile our own kernel. In most of the cases we won't
    want to compile and install our own version of a database engine nor
    Apache or any other 3rd party tool. So my assumption is that we won't
    want to install our CPAN dependencies either. Again - in the standard
    case.

    For people just using an application written in Perl it is even more
    important that they should not deal with all these packages. Most of us
    know how much people suffer when they need to install 10s of modules and
    their dependencies from CPAN. Especially for modules with dependencies
    outside of CPAN.

    While CPAN.pm, CPANPLUS.pm have improved a lot they still cannot deal
    with cases when one of the dependencies fails to install cleanly.

    In addition while we usually want to work with recent versions of
    modules from CPAN, we usually don't want to get the bleeding edge.
    Espcially not in applications.

Guidelines for inclusion
    In addition to the guidelines of each distribution on which module to
    include, when to upgrade etc. we would like to setup our own guidelines
    to help people decide what to include, what would be the priorites, when
    to upgrade a module etc.

    A few guidelines on how to select and prioritize modules:

    * Modules that are dependencies of another module by a different module
    author.
    * Modules that require compilation
    * Modules that require files not on CPAN
        Such modules are especially difficult to install with CPAN.pm or
        CPANPLUS as they require files outside the scope of CPAN. Making
        sure such modules and their dependencies can be installed with the
        standard packaging system gets extra points.

    * Web development frameworks
    * Modules required by some of the big open source Perl applications.
             For a good listing see the journal entry of brian d foy
             L<http://use.perl.org/~brian_d_foy/journal/9974>

    Requirements for inclusion or upgrade

    * The module already has all its prereq in the system
    * The module passes all its tests with its prereqs currently in the
    system on the system
    * The tests of all the currently available dependent modules in the
    system pass with this new version
    * A broader requirement would be that the version has no failing test
    reports on any other system, though this requirement might be too harsh
    and unnecessary
Distributions
    For our purposes a distribution is one if the Linux (or BSD)
    distributions with its own rpm or deb (...) based packaging system. It
    can also be some stand-alone Perl package such as the ActivePerl of
    ActiveState or Vanilla and Strawberry Perl.

  Ubuntu
    My current understanding is that the best way to get CPAN modules into
    Ubuntu is to get them into Debian unstable and then sync them into
    Ubuntu universe.

    Look at Gutsy Gibson (7.10) development forum
    <http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=238> and more specifically
    at Requesting New Packages for Inclusion in Gutsy Universe
    <http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=414355>

  Fedora
    More details needed.

    For now look at <http://fedoraproject.org/> and

  RedHat
  Mandriva
    MDV::Distribconf

  SuSE
  Gentoo
    As in Gentoo the standard way is to install everything from source and
    they have some way to channel all CPAN via their system for Gentoo this
    whole issue is probably not relevant.

  FreeBSD
  NetBSD
  OpenBSD
  ActivePerl
    ActivePerl is distribute by ActiveState <http://www.activestate.com/>
    Its list of packages far exceeds of any of the other distributions
    listed here. It is based on the automatic build system of ActiveState.

  Strawberry and Vanilla

TODO
    * Collect the basic information for the main distributions
